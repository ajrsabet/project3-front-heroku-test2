// FROM THE VERY BEGINNING

1. Create Repo, Create Development Branch, set Default to Development and add rules

2. Clone Repo to Local Machine

3. git checkout -b <initials_feature_version#>

4. Code baby Code

5. Save changes when you feel the need. 
  => git add . (or specific file names) 
  => git commit -m '<specific and meaningful message>'
  => git pull origin development
  => git push
  => run --set-upstream message from console
  // this save your current work on github, no need to create pull request until feature is complete

6. Once feature is complete => Create pull request on github

7. On local machine, git checkout development

8. git pull origin development 
  // now your local development branch is up to date with githubs development branch

9. git checkout -b <initials_feature_version#>
